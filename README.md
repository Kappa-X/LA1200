# LA1200

This is my first little game in C#. The goal of this game is to guess the right number between 1 and 100. To help the user everytime he doesn't guess the right number the console gives him a tip if the number is higher or lower than the number he guessed. Also I add some features like diffrent colors for right and false answers and a beep sound that signals that your guess is false.
